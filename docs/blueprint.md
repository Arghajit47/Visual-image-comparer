- Primary color: A calming blue (#64B5F6) to represent clarity and precision, reflecting the app's purpose. It's a versatile hue that evokes trust.
- Background color: A very light blue-gray (#F0F4F8), nearly white, to ensure the images and results stand out.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FFAB40), positioned to the 'left' of blue on the color wheel, to draw attention to key actions and results.
- Clean, sans-serif font for clear display of percentage differences and instructions.
- Side-by-side image display with clear labeling (Base Image, Actual Image, Diff Image).
- Subtle transitions when displaying the comparison results and diff image.
